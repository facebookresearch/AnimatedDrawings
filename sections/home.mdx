## Animated Drawings

This repo contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper, `A Method for Automatically Animating Children's Drawings of the Human Figure' (currenly under peer review). 

In addition, this repo aims to be a useful creative tool in its own right, allowing you to flexibly create animations starring your own drawn characters.

## Using Animated Drawings

Once you've installed AnimatedDrawings, using it is as simple as importing the package and specifying a configuration file.
Here's an example:

```python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/interactive_window_example.yaml')
```
And the resulting window:

## Options

By modifying the configuration files, you can switch characters, apply different motions, change output formats, and more!
Here are a couple examples:

### Adding a background image
Suppose you'd like to add a background to the animation. You can do so by specifying the image path within the config.
Run the following commands from a Python interpreter within the AnimatedDrawings root directory:

```python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/background_example.yaml')
```

<Gallery columns={2} color="red-50" spaceTop spaceBottom>
  <Image url="/assets/images/char4_original_image.png" />
  <Image url="/assets/images/background_example.gif" />
</Gallery>
