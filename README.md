# Gradio UI for Animated Drawings
I really love the Animated Drawings tool, but it was quite hard to explain how to use it to friends. This is why i decided to create this more convinient way using a Gradio Interface.

To utilize this tool, follow these simple steps:

### Setup and Starting the Gradio UI
0. Run the shell script "start_gradio.sh" in the terminal. It will install gradio and run the "gradio_script.py" script. open the localhost on your browser and start using it!

### Inside of the GUI
1. Input the directory path to your AnimatedDrawings folder.
2. Specify your desired output directory for the generated .yaml file.
3. Click the "Refresh" button to populate the drop-down menus for Character, Motion, and Target. This action will populate these fields based on the folder names in the .../AnimatedDrawings/examples/characters directory for Characters, filenames in the .../AnimatedDrawings/config/motion directory for Motion, and filenames in the .../AnimatedDrawings/config/retarget directory for Target.
4. Next, select your preferred export option - file only, video, or GIF. Choosing MP4 will present a preview directly in the Gradio interface.
5. Finally, click "Export" to generate and export your MVC .yaml files.

I hope you all find this tool beneficial and enjoyable to use. My next step will involve the Docker part of AnimatedDrawings, though I'm still familiarizing myself with it, so stay tuned for more developments!

# Animated Drawings

![Sequence 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/219223438-2c93f9cb-d4b5-45e9-a433-149ed76affa6.gif)


This repo contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper, [A Method for Animating Children's Drawings of the Human Figure](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3592788).

In addition, this repo aims to be a useful creative tool in its own right, allowing you to flexibly create animations starring your own drawn characters. If you do create something fun with this, let us know! Use hashtag **#FAIRAnimatedDrawings**, or tag me on twitter: [@hjessmith](https://twitter.com/hjessmith/).

## Installation
*This project has been tested with macOS Ventura 13.2.1 and Ubuntu 18.04. If you're installing on another operating system, you may encounter issues.*

We *strongly* recommend activating a Python virtual environment prior to installing Animated Drawings.
Conda's Miniconda is a great choice. Follow [these steps](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) to download and install it. Then run the following commands:

````bash
    # create and activate the virtual environment
    conda create --name animated_drawings python=3.8.13
    conda activate animated_drawings

    # clone AnimatedDrawings and use pip to install
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/AnimatedDrawings.git
    cd AnimatedDrawings
    pip install -e .
````

Mac M1/M2 users: if you get architecture errors, make sure your `~/.condarc` does not have `osx-64`, but only `osx-arm64` and `noarch` in its subdirs listing. You can see that it's going to go sideways as early as `conda create` because it will show `osx-64` instead of `osx-arm64` versions of libraries under "The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED".

## Using Animated Drawings

### Quick Start
Now that everything's set up, let's animate some drawings! To get started, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal and activate the animated_drawings conda environment:
````bash
~ % conda activate animated_drawings
````

2. Ensure you're in the root directory of AnimatedDrawings:
````bash
(animated_drawings) ~ % cd {location of AnimatedDrawings on your computer}
````

3. Start up a Python interpreter:
````bash
(animated_drawings) AnimatedDrawings % python
````

4. Copy and paste the follow two lines into the interpreter:
````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/interactive_window_example.yaml')
````

If everything is installed correctly, an interactive window should appear on your screen.
(Use spacebar to pause/unpause the scene, arrow keys to move back and forth in time, and q to close the screen.)

<img src='./media/interactive_window_example.gif' width="256" height="256" /> </br></br></br>

There's a lot happening behind the scenes here. Characters, motions, scenes, and more are all controlled by configuration files, such as `interactive_window_example.yaml`. Below, we show how different effects can be achieved by varying the config files. You can learn more about the [config files here](examples/config/README.md).

### Export MP4 video

Suppose you'd like to save the animation as a video file instead of viewing it directly in a window. Specify a different example config by copying these lines into the Python interpreter:

````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/export_mp4_example.yaml')
````

Instead of an interactive window, the animation was saved to a file, video.mp4, located in the same directory as your script.

<img src='./media/mp4_export_video.gif' width="256" height="256" /> </br></br></br>

### Export transparent .gif

Perhaps you'd like a transparent .gif instead of an .mp4? Copy these lines in the Python interpreter instead:

````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/export_gif_example.yaml')
````

Instead of an interactive window, the animation was saved to a file, video.gif, located in the same directory as your script.

<img src='./media/gif_export_video.gif' width="256" height="256" /> </br></br></br>

### Headless Rendering

If you'd like to generate a video headlessly (e.g. on a remote server accessed via ssh), you'll need to specify `USE_MESA: True` within the `view` section of the config file.

````yaml
    view:
      USE_MESA: True
````

### Animating Your Own Drawing

All of the examples above use drawings with pre-existing annotations.
To understand what we mean by *annotations* here, look at one of the 'pre-rigged' character's [annotation files](examples/characters/char1/).
You can use whatever process you'd like to create those annotations files and, as long as they are valid, AnimatedDrawings will give you an animation.

So you'd like to animate your own drawn character.
I wouldn't want you to create those annotation files manually. That would be tedious.
To make it fast and easy, we've trained a drawn humanoid figure detector and pose estimator and provided scripts to automatically generate annotation files from the model predictions.
There are currently two options for setting this up.

#### Option 1: Docker
To get it working, you'll need to set up a Docker container that runs TorchServe.
This allows us to quickly show your image to our machine learning models and receive their predictions.

To set up the container, follow these steps:

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
3. Run the following commands, starting from the Animated Drawings root directory:

````bash
    (animated_drawings) AnimatedDrawings % cd torchserve

    # build the docker image... this takes a while (~5-7 minutes on Macbook Pro 2021)
    (animated_drawings) torchserve % docker build -t docker_torchserve .

    # start the docker container and expose the necessary ports
    (animated_drawings) torchserve % docker run -d --name docker_torchserve -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 docker_torchserve
````

Wait ~10 seconds, then ensure Docker and TorchServe are working by pinging the server:

````bash
    (animated_drawings) torchserve % curl http://localhost:8080/ping

    # should return:
    # {
    #   "status": "Healthy"
    # }
````

If, after waiting, the response is `curl: (52) Empty reply from server`, one of two things is likely happening.
1. Torchserve hasn't finished initializing yet, so wait another 10 seconds and try again.
2. Torchserve is failing because it doesn't have enough RAM.  Try [increasing the amount of memory available to your Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#advanced) to 16GB by modifying Docker Desktop's settings.

With that set up, you can now go directly from image -> animation with a single command:

````bash
    (animated_drawings) torchserve % cd ../examples
    (animated_drawings) examples % python image_to_animation.py drawings/garlic.png garlic_out
````

As you waited, the image located at `drawings/garlic.png` was analyzed, the character detected, segmented, and rigged, and it was animated using BVH motion data from a human actor.
The resulting animation was saved as `./garlic_out/video.gif`.

<img src='./examples/drawings/garlic.png' height="256" /><img src='./media/garlic.gif' width="256" height="256" /></br></br></br>

#### Option 2: Running locally on macOS

Getting Docker working can be complicated, and it's unnecessary if you just want to play around with this locally.
Contributer @Gravityrail kindly submitted a script that sets up Torchserve locally on MacOS, no Docker required.

```bash
cd torchserve
./setup_macos.sh
torchserve --start --ts-config config.local.properties --foreground
```

With torchserve running locally like this, you can use the same command as before to make the garlic dance:

```bash 
python image_to_animation.py drawings/garlic.png garlic_out
```
### Fixing bad predictions
You may notice that, when you ran `python image_to_animation.py drawings/garlic.png garlic_out`, there were additional non-video files within `garlic_out`.
`mask.png`, `texture.png`, and `char_cfg.yaml` contain annotation results of the image character analysis step. These annotations were created from our model predictions.
If the mask predictions are incorrect, you can edit the mask with an image editing program like Paint or Photoshop.
If the joint predictions are incorrect, you can run `python fix_annotations.py` to launch a web interface to visualize, correct, and update the annotations. Pass it the location of the folder containing incorrect joint predictions (here we use `garlic_out/` as an example):

````bash
    (animated_drawings) examples % python fix_annotations.py garlic_out/
    ...
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5050
    Press CTRL+C to quit
````

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5050` in your browser to access the web interface. Drag the joints into the appropriate positions, and hit `Submit` to save your edits.

Once you've modified the annotations, you can render an animation using them like so:

````bash
    # specify the folder where the fixed annoations are located
    (animated_drawings) examples % python annotations_to_animation.py garlic_out
````

### Adding multiple characters to scene
Multiple characters can be added to a video by specifying multiple entries within the config scene's 'ANIMATED_CHARACTERS' list.
To see for yourself, run the following commands from a Python interpreter within the AnimatedDrawings root directory:

````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/multiple_characters_example.yaml')
````
<img src='./examples/characters/char1/texture.png' height="256" /> <img src='./examples/characters/char2/texture.png' height="256" /> <img src='./media/multiple_characters_example.gif' height="256" />

### Adding a background image
Suppose you'd like to add a background to the animation. You can do so by specifying the image path within the config.
Run the following commands from a Python interpreter within the AnimatedDrawings root directory:

````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/background_example.yaml')
````

<img src='./examples/characters/char4/texture.png' height="256" /> <img src='./examples/characters/char4/background.png' height="256" /> <img src='./media/background_example.gif' height="256" />

### Using BVH Files with Different Skeletons
You can use any motion clip you'd like, as long as it is in BVH format.

If the BVH's skeleton differs from the examples used in this project, you'll need to create a new motion config file and retarget config file.
Once you've done that, you should be good to go.
The following code and resulting clip uses a BVH with completely different skeleton.
Run the following commands from a Python interpreter within the AnimatedDrawings root directory:

````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/different_bvh_skeleton_example.yaml')
````

<img src='./media/different_bvh_skeleton_example.gif' height="256" />

### Creating Your Own BVH Files
You may be wondering how you can create BVH files of your own.
You used to need a motion capture studio.
But now, thankfully, there are simple and accessible options for getting 3D motion data from a single RGB video.
For example, I created this Readme's banner animation by:
1. Recording myself doing a silly dance with my phone's camera.
2. Using [Rokoko](https://www.rokoko.com/) to export a BVH from my video.
3. Creating a new [motion config file](examples/config/README.md#motion) and [retarget config file](examples/config/README.md#retarget) to fit the skeleton exported by Rokoko.
4. Using AnimatedDrawings to animate the characters and export a transparent animated gif.
5. Combining the animated gif, original video, and original drawings in Adobe Premiere.
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/219223438-2c93f9cb-d4b5-45e9-a433-149ed76affa6.gif' height="256" />

Here is an example of the configs I used apply my motion to a character. To use these config files, ensure that the Rokoko exports the BVH with the Mixamo skeleton preset:

 ````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/rokoko_motion_example.yaml')
 ````

It will show this in a new window:

![Sequence 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/233157474-1506d219-c085-49f9-a537-43d6c1bae93a.gif)




### Adding Addition Character Skeletons
All of the example animations above depict "human-like" characters; they have two arms and two legs.
Our method is primarily designed with these human-like characters in mind, and the provided pose estimation model assumes a human-like skeleton is present.
But you can manually specify a different skeletons within the `character config` and modify the specified `retarget config` to support it.
If you're interested, look at the configuration files specified in the two examples below.


````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/six_arms_example.yaml')
````

<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/223584962-925ee5aa-11de-47e5-ace2-a6d5940b34ae.png' height="256" /><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/223585000-dc8acf4e-974d-4cae-998b-94543f5f42c8.gif' width="256" height="256" /></br></br></br>

````python
from animated_drawings import render
render.start('./examples/config/mvc/four_legs_example.yaml')
````

<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/223585033-f11e4e66-0443-405a-80e5-09b6aa0e335d.png' height="256" /><img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6675724/223585043-7ce9eac0-bb4c-4547-b038-c63ca2852ef2.gif' width="256" height="256" /></br></br></br>
